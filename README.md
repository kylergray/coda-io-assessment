I used the Tasty API. This API enables you to quickly find recipes of all with various tags, and quickly search for them using key words, something that fit well to the description of this assessment.

My application allows you to find great recipes, filter recipes based on their tags, as well as see who created the recipe, if they are easily shoppable, and show a preview of the item.

I utilized bootstrap to enable the website to be responsive. This meant only showing as many cards horizontally that would fit onto the size of the screen the user is viewing the site from. Additionally, the font scales to match the device to be readable.

My app has high contrast ratios between text and its background, it also has associated alt tags for content to allow screen readers to process the content for those who cannot see it.

I would enable more complex searches and filtering for things such as reviews, popularity, cook time, etc. I could structure my search query to take advantage of the API for most of these filters, but for some of it I could parse the json response and filter out any data that does not match desired filters.
